    <p>Focaccia flatbread is topped with roasted persimmon slices, burrata cheese, and rosemary for a sweet and savory lunch or appetizer.</p>
    <ul class="align-left">
        <li>1 precooked 9-inch focaccia flatbread</li>
        <li>1 Fuyu persimmon, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch rounds</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves stripped</li>
        <li>½ cup burrata cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol class="align-left">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Lay persimmon slices onto the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 teaspoons olive oil and sprinkle salt on top. Sprinkle 1/2 the rosemary leaves over the persimmon slices.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn persimmon slices over and roast 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Remove baking sheet from the oven and increase temperature to 200 degrees C. Place focaccia on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake focaccia in the hot oven until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven and top focaccia with roasted persimmon slices. Tear burrata cheese using your hands and lay evenly on the focaccia, avoiding the persimmon slices. Reserve about 1 tablespoon rosemary leaves and sprinkle the rest on top.</li>
        <li>Return focaccia to the hot oven and bake until warmed and burrata cheese has melted slightly, about 5 minutes. Top with reserved fresh rosemary leaves and drizzle remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil on top. Slice and serve hot.</li>
